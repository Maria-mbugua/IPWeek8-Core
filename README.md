# DECISION_TREES_AND_SVM

# a) Specifying the Question

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

# b) Defining the Metrics of success

Building a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

# c) Understanding the context

Knowing the factor symptoms of hypothroid.

# d) Recording the Experimental Design

1. Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.

2. Read and explore the given dataset.

3. Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

4. Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

5. Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.

6. Performing regression analysis.

7. Provide a recommendation based on your analysis.

8. Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements in model improvement.

# e) Relevance of the data

The data used for this project is necessary for building a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.
